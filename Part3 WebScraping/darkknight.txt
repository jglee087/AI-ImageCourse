 ** PLOT SPOILERS EVERYWHERE ** Christopher Nolan 's `` Dark Knight '' one better film history genre , however , qualify masterpiece . fact , 's quite far distinction . fall short unquestionable excellence ridiculously high number plot hole , regard Joker criminal exploits.It given Heath Ledger 's portrayal Joker leaf u character thoughtful , unpredictable , ruthless , unrelenting , arguably insane . say , inconsistency villain accepted , embraced . others , frank , unacceptable stupidity . example : film 's opening sequence , clever bank heist spearheaded Joker , crazed clown kill partner caper progress . time , made sense . Pretty simple , colleague kill , money leaf . later film , Joker burn half criminal underworld 's combined fortune . make overtly clear motivated money . least bit.So money factor opening scene ? n't . Uneven scripting there.But 's nitpicking comparison film 's greater fault . ultimate reason `` Dark Knight '' fall short masterpiece label absolutely way , circumstance , time , planet solar system , Joker could execute many complex plan short period time.OK , people start saying : `` 's movie ! n't possible . '' know , thanks . agree , n't possible . , huge , film ambitious lengthy `` Dark Knight '' want taken seriously . want taken seriously , think director Christopher Nolan want Oscar consideration work put , cast member saying regularly n't want considered mere `` superhero movie , '' `` action movie . '' Well want elevate level serious drama , explain thing . ( 1 ) Joker continue find willing participant escapade previous crew member end dead jail ? guy 's finding work true idiot . Totally brainless . n't work Joker 's plan meticulous require precise timing execution . goon dumb enough work , n't smart enough effective help . 's perpetual contradiction throughout film , particularly second act . ( 2 ) Sure Joker swift tricky , c'mon , n't exactly look like normal citizen . city-wide security heightened level never seen , hell maniac painted face wacky hair spotted ? invisible transportation machine something ? n't supernatural power , n't supernatural aura . ( 3 ) time wire hospital bomb ? Even one goon , one hospital notice suspicious activity ? assassination attempt Mayor ? cop firing line n't notice infamous villain city standing right next ? ? crouched little tried make eye contact ? Please . could go day , many plot liberty taken.I 'd actually like discus performance bit . think separation strongest part rest cast largest ever ensemble size magnitude . Meaning , Heath Ledger 's performance far away best film , better point bothered one else realm . scene Ledger screen lacked magnetism intrigue one appeared . Although appeared probably best word , like dominated . Christian Bale OK Batman , 's almost stoic character strong moral opinion . 's also little bit stiff 's playboy mode Bruce Wayne . think performance `` Prestige '' emotional , effective , polished.Aaron Eckhart right Harvey Dent/Two-Face , problem vast majority time seeing Eckhart screen , Dent . Eckhart saw `` Thank Smoking . '' Also , man finely tuned social philosophy , like Dent , would totally flip ideology loss close loved one . Hopefully angle toxin causing disfigurement messed brain led believe.Michael Caine Morgan Freeman believable always , course underused Alfred Lucius Fox . Gary Oldman probably contributed second strongest performance film Commissioner Gordon , Maggie Gyllenhaal ( Rachel Dawes ) step Katie Holmes far execution timing -- 's saying much . really could go day unacceptable plot liberty , 'll spare . , liked film thought-provoking sequence involving moral dilemma intriguing societal question , `` Dark Knight '' succeeded escaping `` superhero movie '' label . 's masterpiece.Plain simply , many hole .
 Im gon na start saying LOVE movie.Its one favorite time . honestly cant think much wrong movie little long Batmans infamous voice . everything else top notch . acting , story , atmosphere , action scene amazing . n't seen movie see right ! went expecting much came blown away , cant imagine movie much better . 'll wait Dark Knight Rises release see anything better . , stand best movie 've ever seen
 saw dark knight three year ago 8th grade . blown away beautifully done , camera work , acting , story , took surprise . day one best movie ever seen see . movie impact intense way Dark Knight . movie worth seeing due fact worker put much time effort one film want waste money putting garbage . Christopher Nolan , thank wasting time , instead earning time film . day still anxious see movie home . recommend anyone like action movie general . anyone n't , n't waste time write bad review film .
 hyped movie year probably one hyped movie ever . Even overhype see Heath Ledger play joker trailer looked awesome . finally paid ticket watched movie.The movie start really strong , opening scene absolute blast ( literally ) . point though n't feel action . rest movie seemed , drawn completely top . Honestly joker find rocket launcher Gotham City ? movie long much dialogue something kid writes senior creative writing think 's brilliant . Also director excellent job warping joker one place next , joker must helicopter really loyal taxi driver . One second 's next 's top building . Probably last straw Morgan Freeman showed . turn around camera low angle show arrival Morgan Freeman ultimate modern narrator every movie , older version Samuel L Jackson soft spoken . kind made Debo Friday showed scary convict boat.After sitting seat two half hour character appeared disappeared movie finally ended , ended cliché way . Way say title movie last word film , thats never done ever ? Dark Knight include bain every modern movie , able track people 's cell phone call . little gimmick way many movie days.so ya sat two half house butt really hurt , wasted ten dollar cool movie , one n't good people claimed . Maybe next time Christian Bale take cough drop showing set .
 Dark Knight maintained intensity overall gunmetal grayish feel set Batman apart . film take u Gotham City grown accustomed big bat 's crime-fighting crusade , last remaining big time criminal actually grown fearful wrath . form alliance attempt keep illicit business activity alive feeling even pressure yet different angle : passionate fearless new district attorney , Harvey Dent . Recognizing crime group 's looming extinction , stranger enters circle offer think solution : kill Batman.The bad guy n't know trust seemingly demented madman , later learn hard way n't really choice , disturbing part Joker 's personality motive . n't care money power . enjoys causing trouble watching , pleasure , sideline , terrorized city scramble mayhem ... lead real star film , Heath Ledger.Ledger 's performance Joker astounding consuming . come face-to-face villain bearing coldness psychopath personality remains mysterious inexplicable real reason scar face . develops air lone offender quite early nonchalantly kill help commit crime . Yet , problem building army follower , viewer easily find believable . insane , 's focused quite determined . Ledger also brings Joker 's humor role , way unique interpretation ... subtlety honesty . word mannerism made laugh also evoked feeling sadness clarity . evil incredibly convincing.Although Batman character often marketed towards kid , film definitely appropriate young child . addition dark image , violence , seen implied , sometimes unsettling , Ledger 's Joker chilling even adult viewer . said , , far , one best film 've ever seen , easily find place personal top ten . disappointed Joker , best villain film since Hannibal Lecter , never revealed u .
 Obviously Christopher Nolan trying touch one prominent issue recent time . environment . recycling tired old joke set piece many action film , rest plot salvaged toilet rubbish bin . also come perfect formula make profound sentence , taking two word mean complete opposite shoving together.Joking aside , almost nodding first hour half second half movie actually pretty good , albeit drawn ending frustrating . literally left joker hanging dealing completely pointless irrational side-story two-face . 'd thought man dent 's resolve would made stronger event took place , get back joker stop event happening people , instead deteriorating monster similar calibre joker.I really n't think film got best actor involved , probably due script . Christian Bale fantastic actor , completely wasted batman spends time jumping bat-suit using silly voice , instead displaying incredible character acting skill movie American Psycho Machinist . Heath Ledger 's performance real solid one entire cast , however plenty time guilty completely over-acting . introduction member mob farcical laughter cinema due awkwardness stupidity situation.The main reason think film totally fails Christopher Nolans approach trying make film really realistic explanation everything . man running around bat costume man dressed clown make-up surreal try addressed manner . think original Batman lot better n't try ultra-realistic took comic fairly serious tone comedic undercurrent . Christopher Nolan undoubtedly talent director , memento , prestige even insomnia great film feel attempt batman franchise far outshone Tim Burton.Obviously film already hit nothing anyone write stop , however must implore actually watch film critically realise shortcoming , get swept away hype .
 settled 5/10 Dark Knight . appreciated story structure note hit ... n't think played loudly . n't like re-casting , replacement Katie Holmes/Rachel original Barbara Gordon actress ( yes , , didya notice ? ) awkward distracting . lack blood film complement multitude beating killing ( sustain PG-13 rating ) nullifies tension present brilliantly conceived scenario . n't believe second victim several hostage situation ( mass otherwise ) would actually lose life , 's blisteringly apparent onset film PG-13 , would never disturb audience beyond minimum necessary plot point . Joker actually underwritten . Ledger game performance solid , honestly : Throw makeup stringy hair 75 % capable actor , product . think Jack Nicholson 's output ultimately interesting , think Tim Burton 's original film , although imperfect , still entertaining pantheon.I realize hardcore Batman fan , wet dream grittiness graphic novel transposed big screen ( say ; say came close ) , riddle : script fashioned non-superhero flick , let 's say Heat II , strong performance production value , would lack Batman fan loyalty still rocket current position IMDb Top 250 ?
 Well , one anticipated movie year far . ? excellent . far best Batman film ever made course one memorable action film long while.Everyone waiting see well Heath Ledger performed Joker film . definitely deserves Oscar honor . character dark creepy sent chill back . Compared Heath 's film like '10 Things Hate ' even 'Brokeback Mountain ' prof man could actually act , n't matter character , could it.The film 's storyline many twist rewarding , story developed constantly scene , making wonder 's next . Excellent craft flow well towards conclusion.During film scene Batman Joker , Bike v Truck . People thought ending . , kept going awesome , story kept getting darker darker , guess 's called 'Dark ' Knight well relation Batman himself.The cast great . Christopher Nolan playing Batman , good performance , Heath Ledger played extremely well , Maggie annoying time , still deserves praised . Michael Caine Morgan Freeman minor role satisfied audience . Aaron Eckhart start minor role slowly progress becomes evil quite surprising entertaining watch.Great directing made movie enjoyable , added action time made film feel powerful , lighting done well especially showing Harvey/ Two Face 's face many mood displayed.Great explosion made entertaining . Made feel great finally best action come long time.This movie deserves 10/10 rating credit behalf great young actor Heath Ledger 's life .

 reading quite review state curious movie . kid loved read superhero comic book , spiderman batman favourite . Loving spiderman movie also liking first new Batman movie Nolan wanting see last performance Heath Ledger could n't wait see movie.Man disappointed.Do n't get wrong , liked movie , fun performance bij Heath Ledger something never forget . sceptical people tend exaggerate performance popular dead actor must honestly admit , blew away . also blew every actor away shared screen time , liked gary oldman best together scene . still wowed Hedgers performance , must admit really feel frustrated gone , performance MUST get Oscar.Caine good , Bale OK although n't like batman , good Bruce Wayne good batman really enjoyed Aaron Eckart Harvey Dent.But thought movie also quite flaws.Without giving away much really though combat action scene easily watchable fast follow , really n't like way went two face , ending sequence bat joker let . Also n't like way Nolan tell story must admit , thats personal opinion.There 2 surprising moment really loved , one containing pencil got laughing hard choice sequence ended way n't see coming loved it.All , OK superhero movie , 7 star 9 ? come people , 's crazy.It 's unbelievable movie like matrix 1 , gladiator , good get , l.a. confidential , eternal sunshine spotless mind n't rank high movie , cant understand although respect it.Happy share feel movie , Realkane
 first word Christian Bale utters eponymous role 'soon-to-be-Batman ' Bruce Wayne , preceding Batman film entitled Batman Begins , thug remote prison located Far East : `` 're Devil , 're practise '' hiss . feeling 's 2008 's Dark Knight practise end fight Devil begin . second crack writing something film , said initially little unfocused targeted wrong area ; stand initial grade gave similarly retained similar sense feeling underwhelmed finished . Even deemed Dark Knight one better comic book adaptation ever made , saying terrible lot given bulk entry said film canon.That old problem dealing war genre one 's best document war horrid , gut-wrenching thing whilst maintaining sequence war help carry sense spectacle anyway , rear head . Dark Knight document war terrorism see Christohper Nolan attempt echo greater sense thing real world unleashes character known Joker ( Ledger ) amongst inhabitant Gotham City , result terrorist 'acts ' bringing entire building allow Nolan shoot wreckage said act firefighter foreground smoking rubble back , clearly calling immediate 'post ' imagery 9/11 New York attack . Incidentally , one source escape suggested , Joker 's video captive held forced talk video camera evoke action overseas terrorist cell , method getting message across West ; scene seen pottering around area trying intimidate carry odd , distorted erratic hand held aesthetic suggesting danger , distortion chaos . Later , semiology linked fire fighting used briefest fashion , certain character , 's threat Joker , transported police van : burning fire truck used blockade , Nolan cleverly instills sense victimised anguish audience.In addition biting , Nolan best render film gangster film-come-neo noir whilst operating banner low MPAA/BBFC rating film additionally attempt draw parallel Joker , Batman third piece triangle district attorney Harvey Dent ( Eckhart ) . Indeed film open audacious robbery mob money , perpetrated Joker ; menace established fact cohort contribute varying perspective man whilst perceive still screen . robbery carry clever twist member kill job done , small highly affecting twinge proceeding dreamt Joker thus cementing personality mindset able cook something . fighter crime , Dent lack physical strength Batman talk good talk able place number criminal jail hard work adopts stance front line crime . Shortly afterwards , Gary Oldman 's police lieutenant Jim Gordon refers Gotham 's `` white knight '' , suggesting man share similar overview Batman 's `` dark '' different technique characteristics.Joker 's parallel Batman see film establish relationship way two accompanying scene , one seeing Joker handful representative Gotham 's gang occupy kitchen talk certain issue . Annoyingly , representative generic bling-wielding African-Americans ; well dressed Italian American mobster gruff , greasy haired eastern European criminal . Cut Gordon , Batman Dent beside bat signal exact thing whose discussion ideology obviously differ ; later pairing sequence seeing Joker deal black criminal , feel ought working , blunt fashion Batman Chinese businessman named Lau feel similarly towards sense , thus suggesting intrinsic link two . rule thumb film Heat American Gangster , Joker Batman share sequence sit opposite one another table ; occasion , source stated , right contemporary issue treatment terrorist custody arisen.Where film fall apart want cater audience superhero sub-genre frill , interesting parallel drawn Dent frothing mouth monster named Two-Face seeking revenge Batman , two people differently channelling anger born injustice towards people love play , getting bogged sort fight scene ridiculous sequence 'sonar vision ' nothing juvenalise adult content . second unit stuff nowhere near interesting talk studious observation identity personality ; chase tunnel spill onto street involving police van ; large truck bat-bike rather underwhelming . film relies rife corruption often narrative send another avenue twist turn , ultimately story interesting aforementioned character study power play going binary opposite supposedly attract everybody 's linked . Ultimately fleetingly interesting , often feel bogged .
 OK , let get way , 'm massive Batman fan . loved TV show kid , really enjoyed early Tim Burton film even worn costume occasion . 've even taken time read Batman comic graphic novel . thought Christian Bale excellent choice lead role new film thought first one great start really looking forward one . come 've walked cinema feeling disappointed ? ? film n't good . 's far long , little fun take seriously 's painful . maker thrown kitchen sink little thought . whole thing one great , big , dreadful , noisy , mess . good thing Heath Ledger 's performance . doubt first heard 'd 'd cast got ta hand Heath , pulled . thanks film however , cooked 's burnt .

 Many commenters said `` blown away , '' probably succeeded blowing away box office . waited second week , high expectation 9 10 rating receiving . , fellow movie/film viewer ( especially great film lover ) ... really ! ? 's doubt action action action one , thus , special effect . 's main reason enjoy fantasy flick -- comic book genre . , one perhaps better last Batman last Spiderman last super hero ( would rank Iron Man ) . , special effect makeup may earn awards.Maybe 'm beginning burn action special effect movie , though . perhaps need movie . 45 minute go , ready end . way long . reviewer thought acting superb . acting -- mean one- two-minute interlude fast furious segment action destruction ? 'm actor role part -- part substance acting ? True , Heath Ledger good Joker . , , n't ( Nicholson , et al ) ever played role Batman , Superman , etc ? plot -- well , anyone know genre story combine Batman Joker , know expect unexpected Joker . , plot go one unexpected another -- though variety mixture change `` unexpecteds '' trying outdo action mayhem.When saw stand # 1 top 250 right , clicked list . movie acting plot ( yes , even action many case ) could rank like Lord Rings , Star Wars film , many great classic real suspense ( mention Casablanca , Vertigo , North Northwest ) , beyond . 'm far overall trend IMDb review , ca n't agree many rate film top.It 's good entertaining -- long . 's great , mean . love youth today ( grandchild ) , n't mean disparage observation -- think high acclaim many film may reflect large , young audience , member n't great deal quality varied film viewing history . young people , urge look top 250 list major review rating -- rent , borrow otherwise watch great film . promise wo n't disappointed bored -- may get understanding ( maybe appreciation ) past custom , life style , dress , behavior , etc . sure , great entertainment .
 really wanted see theater ; however , never last summer . Instead waited till came cable , watching ; really n't miss anything going theater . rather disappointed expecting good Spiderman , n't think . thought rather slow moving sparse action scene . mean Batman chopper really n't much action . lot film better car chasing scene that.And really n't think Heath Ledger anything special . role lot hype . Probably best role Aaron Eckhart special effect face end.I also comment Christian Bale 's Batman voice . trying ? ? sounded like chronic smoker emphysema.FINAL VERDICT : good , good advertised . n't get many people thought best comic book movie made .
 Whatever else may , `` Dark Knight , '' Christopher Nolan 's follow `` Batman Begins , '' film resurrected Batman franchise , ambitious superhero film ever made . 's full brooding rumination inherent nature humanity , obviously fueled troubled state post-9/11 world , pack awful lot plot two-and-a-half-hour running time . However , cautioned , n't let # 1 rating IMDb set expectation film ca n't possibly meet . doubt experienced film goer truly going think best film ever made.The praise heaped Heath Ledger performance Joker well deserved . Indeed , Joker becomes focus movie , may desirable thing , given ... know ... .a Batman movie . caped crusader fade background installment , point might leave movie forget . Ditto Maggie Gyllenhaal , play love interest , , true superhero movie formula , get practically nothing . Ledger remember . creates fascinating character Joker , 's movie pose major moral question . human nature , Joker suggests , devolve chaos illusion order taken away ; human inherent kindness cause look one another even circumstance seem call self preservation ? One fascinating thing Ledger 's creation Joker motive criminal pose question like . 's money even power -- want create anarchy see happens.I prepared villain screenplay throw mix : Two Face , played well Aaron Eckhart . film long , 's storyline make . Chrisotpher Nolan brother , Jonathan , co-writers film , would done well leave plot line . end film , many character many thing independently one another , film loses focus slightly.The movie look fantastic though , production team wonder Chicago ( live way ) . fact look film one major selling point , pleased finally see superhero film look cinematic rather cartoonish.So ... excellent addition superhero genre completely entertaining experience ... .but 's still , , Batman movie , 's best film since `` Citizen Kane . '' Grade :
 Time corrective . write review , Dark Knight , according IMDb voter , Best . Film . Ever . risk incurring hail brickbat , must demur . Yes , Heath Ledger delivers excellent performance , Gary Oldman Lieutenant -- er , COMMISSIONER Gordon -- 's always pleasure watch Michael Caine Aaron Eckhart . Dark Knight overlong , plotted , logically flawed , philosophically confused film ( ) mistaken great art . Compared comic book movie , 's bad . Compared La Regle du Jeu , ai n't hot . film 's first half actually quite good , seems come timely conclusion somewhere around eighty minute mark . Unfortunately , summer blockbuster , 's another 70 plus minute go , film 's second half distinct letdown . Instead ending neat tidy note , Dark Knight spiral muddled mess bizarre plotting ( prisoner get bomb sewn ? ) , illogic ( Harvey escape hospital explosion -- apparently impervious pain ? ) confusing action ( many ass-kickings little time ) . n't expect 100 % logical consistency genre product , many flaw elision simple common sense Christopher Nolan 's screenplay utter frustration set around two-hour mark . end film , 're expected believe , reason , resident Gotham need revile Batman rather reward good work , setting police pursuit sunset presumably end hero receiving ticket speeding Batcycle . let 's tell like : term 2008 comic book flick , Dark Knight inferior Hellboy II ( least charming amusing ) Hancock ( raise far interesting question nature super hero ) .
 Greatest Super Hero movie time . One Top crime drama time . Greatest Heath Ledger performance . Heath win Oscar like Golden Globe . Nolan MADE Batman.If n't get chance see Imax time re-release.This movie amazing Imax.The opening scene entirely Imax time see city shot well . Also great chase scene done Imax.This must reviewed film time Hey ... .. 's good.Seriously n't seen SHAME !
 Let 's open review fact Batman BEST superhero ever , even coming close level . sequel made unforgettable movie like `` Batman Begins '' expectation EXTREMELY high . think could describe movie word would `` 152 minute pure awesomeness . '' Christopher Nolan probably created best ever comic book adaptation movie . movie adapted much realistic fashion comic book series . First movie PERFECT people like punch , drama , shooting explosion . movie complicated plot keep eye glued screen . 's anything corny , since important character die , ending n't happy , 's flawless . Christian Bale proved one amazing actor . Michael Cane ( portrays Alfred Pennyworth ) make fall love Batman 's loyal butler . anyone seen movie reading review probably wondering n't mentioned main reason movie flawless . yes , ONE main reason : Heath Ledger . Heath Ledger portrayed Batman 's arch nemesis movie : Joker . anyone clue comic book know Joker INCREDIBLE . Heath Ledger 's acting movie turned Joker LEGEND . never seen perfect realistic acting portrayal Joker movie . Joker portrayed much mature fashion comic book , 's good . 's simply impossible describe : 's bold , insane , smart , twisted 's awesome film point love even Batman . n't mentioned , without doubt best movie seen.Those come high expectation seeing `` Batman Begins '' disappointed . advise one age 11 watch movie Two-Face 's appearance rather frightening film contains intense action .
 read enthusiastic review Italy saw movie ranked 1st IMDb 's Top 250 , thought : `` 's strange , Batman ( Begins ) brilliant , 's happening sequel ? really masterpiece ? really league movie like 'Clockwork Orange ' 'Apocalypse ' ? '' . , 's league . . saw , delusion strong . 's good blockbuster action movie , nothing . Let 's see.The following comment contain spoiler . careful.The script original . ton action sequence , say ?

Heath Ledger , Joker , bear quite entire movie . character became secondary . Aaron Eckhart really powerful confirms talent shown `` Thank Smoking '' . others ? Christian Bale one talented actor generation , movie keep one expression time , without mask . Batman personality . Maggie Gyllenhaal one interesting ( underrated ) independent actress New Hollywood , since `` Secretary '' . movie act sequence chance show real talent . Morgan Freeman Michael Cane giant , movie barely appear . Finally : 've never seen many waste talent ! good side coin Christopher Nolan 's work : philosophy . 's really positive constructive movie coherent . 's like positive answer `` Country Old Men '' modern nihilism : Cohen 's movie , Evil absence value 's unstoppable . `` Dark Knight '' , Evil absence value , 's minority , rule . , fight Evil defeat , without super-heroes . theme could explored better . `` Dark Knight '' explores nothing .
 One could n't help sceptical hype surrounding Dark Knight seen , scepticism certainly weighing mind walked cinema . could n't help thinking 'is going amazing expected , hype inevitable reaction death Heath Ledger ? ' safely say anyone still seen Dark Knight ; hype would 've massive even Ledger n't tragically overdosed filming , film mind-blowingly amazing ! action sequence , dialogue , editing , lighting , costume , score , cinematography , Ledger , Bale , Eckhart , Freeman , every-single-tiny-bit cinema ... brilliant.There 's slightest whiff child-friendly-cinema tore Tim Burton 's vision apart ( many ) year ago . Eckhart 's Dent/Two-Face , blow Tommy Lee Jones metaphorical water , shame performance overshadowed Ledger 's even better one , indeed tragic demise.Every insane laugh Ledger 's lip echo excellence , Jack Nicholson proud . However , Ledger 's delivery , commitment , presence dress-wearing-ability far surpass realm merely paying homage Nicholson 's Joker . Nolan Ledger really show Burton Nicholson darkly immense joker be.Not forget Bale , brings portrayal Batman ( barking voice brings ) next level , depth inner conflict create excellent empathy effect audience also create ridiculously good viewing.I could go day , going every actor success , immense Dark Knight ... think probably get message now.As undoubtedly one difficult film bring public , film swamped hype , tragedy , death scandal ; Dark Knight could easily written tragic death Heath Ledger , thank God n't .
 odd spend two hour watching film slowly dawn particularly bothered end , anything , rather wish would end sooner rather later . Dark Knight kind film . Exactly lost interest even , 'm sure , lose interest . Christopher Nolan 's second stab Batman well Christian 'Rant ' Bales , although element , simply good .

 n't think quarter century living 've ever felt disconnected pop-culture large seeing movie . hype uniform praise thought beforehand least solid piece cinematic craft , maybe embellished slightly Heath Ledger 's unexpected death.Unfortunately , movie rock solid proof sometimes mass delusion strike entire society one time . absolutely way film regarded masterpiece , even half-way decent.Let 's get point . First - plot . 's unconvincing whole . Batman basically side character little take backseat Joker train . whine incessantly one need need hang cape . already ! troubled relationship Rachel Dawes zero chemistry 's hard care outcome . idea Joker anarchist , goalless malevolent force sound good paper , translates aimlessness screen . Joker show nowhere seemingly one backing ... snap ! seems like whole world service . trouble hijacking school bus ( blending line school bus driving half collapsed bank ) , hacking public TV feed rigging entire hospital explosive ; apparently ease creator n't feel need reveal shred information . Many event movie make absolutely sense whatsoever . example - purpose Lt. Gordon faking death ? make point showing scene family informed death - get audience buy well ? 's dumb waste time . Harvey Dent become evil sudden ? Sure badly burned , know risk going business steely resolve minute prior . many plot issue , 's pointless listing . easy spot.The acting movie a-OK , actor n't good line character irrelevant puppet . Heath Ledger good sure , take character get tedious - mostly overexposure . Maggie Gyllenhaal good actress , 's wrong role . 's nice-girl-next-door type superficial sound , 's hard believe would two hotshot like Harvey Dent Bruce Wayne chasing . Christian Bale zero material work 've turned Morgan Freeman moralizing nerd . Gary Oldman , Aaron Eckhart especially Michael Caine decent job considering script given work with.The screenplay atrocious , incongruent messy . 's like movie cut-up thousand piece varying length , reshuffled strung together . natural progression event subsequent scene frequently befuddle . take couple minute figure hell going care . 's poorly done.For car chase , fight scene , giant explosion , movie unforgivably boring . 's combination stemming poor script , naive ( barely existent ) plot , flat character ( ca n't remotely identified much le loved hated ) , general lack good sense . also annoying feeling creator rather low opinion viewer intelligence maybe rushed movie come lot material little time , hence low quality.Before end overlong diatribe , let mention three scene absolutely get term pointlessness stupidity . 1 . Batman riding wicked-cool motorcycle approaching aftermath multi vehicle crash accelerates aiming straight Joker . trying accomplish never explained . One thing certain last moment veers right , barely avoiding villain , drive bike without touching brake , straight wall . mean drive wall ( overturned truck , ca n't remember ) full speed like blind man . even chosen hit Joker , hell expect stop ? 2 . one actually occurs couple time least . Batman leap 20th story window fall onto ground unharmed . Unharmed ! n't parachute , bungee cord , n't even spread cape way . hit full blast walked away . one occasion squeeze Ms Dawes fell experienced similarly puzzling lack after-effects . Filmmakers , needle say , n't find prudent even try provide explanation.3 . Joker enters hospital nurse uniform . present logistical problem , OK . However , seems move around hospital freely , also still wearing face paint . mean lower half face covered protective mask , rest clearly visible . 's even funnier Harvey Dent look Joker straight eye face paint n't give away take mask . cartoon ?
 huge fan superhero movie . Batman particular right balance amazing sound effect , score , visuals effect round action keep eye glued screen wanting end film.While film focused big explosion sometimes overload special effect , film manages deliver great dialogue action scene setting good pace action follow.Going recommend n't see yet . definite must watch .
 could n't believe `` Dark knight '' could live hype . 's perhaps biggest surprise . secret , believe , stunning , mature , intelligent script . make best superhero movie ever made . n't enough , Heath Ledger . , newest tragic modern icon present u preview something 'll never see . fearless , extraordinary actor capable fill humanity even grotesque villain . performance master class . Fortunately , Christian Bale 's Batman almost supporting character . Bale good something around mouth stop great . `` Dark Knight '' visually stunning , powerful moving . else could anyone want .
 perfectly made movie , Heath Ledger best . Batman Begins started trend 'dark/serious ' movie , thought movie could n't better ... Dark Knight came outstanding performance Heath Ledger.As much hate Joker character movie , end truly feel bad . Every scene 's get intense eye glued TV , 's really hard get side tracked thinking something else ! Sadly Dark Knight Rises n't great , movie still stand one best movie .
 First 'll say , 're one story 'why ' character , movie , disappointed . director goal explain everything every character , wanted show story instead . feel story went along nicely . movie , look watch , 'm movie person , movie feel like 2 1/2 hour . feel Aaron Eckharts transformation Harvey Dent Two Face sucked . n't play Two Face good enough ... developed much good guy , n't seem able throw 'bad ' Two face role . needed tormented talking ... dramatic . fell short Two Face IMO . Ledgers Joker perfect . lost role . Sometimes watching , see actor part.. case . saw Joker ... crazy , funny , quirky Joker . Oscar worthy ? maybe .
 feel regret seeing film lately.This movie mixture incredible performance absolute photography incredible direction.If credit given movie heath ledger first row.His performance never never after.coming batman , bale usually outstanding.Christopher Nolan handled story emotion , action perfect way.He absolute genius perfect director wide knowledge movie aspects.This master piece Nolan 's art.I amazed joker performance body language confidence attitude list go ... ... heath ledger kept soul movie provided life joker.if u still n't seen movie , hell waiting ... .
 Dark Knight probably best action film 've ever seen . design , tone , special FX , sound , music excellent ; script dense , complex , thorough . performance actor good , particularly Ledger , took Joker realm sociopath 've seen batman character . may Ledger 's best performance short career.The issue extreme grossness goriness Two-Face make up/special FX . think go bit far little bit flesh dangling visible bone structure ( thing believe better previous Bat Mans series ) . , director n't use much `` face time '' character , look remains shocking overdone.Certainly Dark Knight stand quite time best comic book movie , root . However , may also stand masterpiece right .
 one movie time . 's action beyond belief humor break tension really work . also enough emotion round experience . joker one best character time . 's truly amazing . R.I.P Mr. Heath ledger . Christian bale course one best actor ever . 's truly gift watch screen . See movie make better person.The ending perfect amazing . Every time watch pick something new . lot effort put . Better batman begin good inception . 's actually surprisingly rated .
 First thing say comic-book fan . Eastern Europe . important ? something really different USA . USA comic-books part everyday life . . underrated genre , people still think something sissy small child contains fighting dialogue higher level Kapow Boom-Boom . even worse little . always little treasure hunt get . bad rip-off , cheap junk mentioned category , Batman , continually represented quality available kid like . amused loved . Batman first place , amazing villain . especially Joker . best best . Maybe complex , interesting remarkable character ever created.And tell truth , n't entirely satisfied either one Batman film made Dark Knight . Especially considering absolutely brilliant animated series : Batman Animated Series , check like Batman , well worth . first 3 movie okay , Batman Robin Batman Begins sucked big time , different reason . lost hope ever see really good faithful adaptation comic . along came one.Yes overdone part , flaw , bit rushed corny ending , good , meaningful , Heath Ledger ( disliked saw ) absolutely perfect Joker . saw casting , thought disgrace . saw movie thought unearthly good . film suspense , great acting , emotion , interesting coherent plot rare Hollywood blockbuster . Well worth watching anyone everyone . Especially people , think comic-books sissy thing little child ...
 seems lot hype film . write 's sitting # 6 average rating 9.0 . Honestly , n't think 's good . Heath Ledger fun psychopathic side joker , 'm sure 's enjoyable Jack Nicholson - , instance , actual joke ? Michael Caine Alfred - butler speak much correctly , cockney boy n't work . Christian Bale n't seem solid enough Bruce Wayne . 's bit jolly Tim Burton effort - least daylight time - plot twist effect decent , n't think 're particularly ground-breaking . 'd say 's watchable , n't expect hang around top 10 long .
 Quite simply `` Dark Knight '' best superhero movie ever made ( ok , KickAss competitor , strictly speaking , n't `` proper '' superhero movie , let 's forget ) .Batman tough , Batman loved , Batman weak , Batman hated . Batman human characteristic . Batman 's enemy human characteristic . first main reason Dark Knight succeeds . n't `` '' superhero movie . 's also study character , good `` dark '' perception `` society . '' mean , well sometimes think superhero content scapegoat deeper thought movie even though know 's . Secondly , Batman n't anything unbelievable . Look Superman , 's flying . Look Spiderman , 's got web coming palm . Look Hulk get MASSIVE angry . 's cool entertaining , Batman , imo , superhero connect closest , n't `` ability '' soooo unrealistic . , inner outer character human like make movie much enjoyable . action ? action Dark Knight amazing ! Batman 's car amazing ! special effect amazing ! phenomenal piece work crafting movie look feel fantastic ! wo n't talk much Heath Ledger 's portrayal joker . 's definitely best performance ever , better time death , peace upon . hate ball watching guy act . 's created insanely unique persona . loved ! Everything Dark Knight work . 's got much novelty . 's rare piece cinema prima facie 's kid , ultimately , adult end enjoying much . Dark Knight n't kid anyway , wont able comprehend bigger picture Dark Knight , make movie special . 's cool 's original 's awesomeI ca n't believe n't nominated Best Picture . Oscars probably stunned good super hero movie could . mention also love Gary Oldman , guy play different person every movie , never tell
 one best 've watched movie trilogy . n't see TDK superhero comic book movie screenplay written perfect way . Created Nolan Batsuit-mobile perfect design . beautiful thing film return Joker 's Ledger Joker created amazing acting . good evil sits talk like interrogation scene , everyone audience shuts listens say . 's think movie great . like actor portray character Rachel Dawes . Nolan team great job . make 100 movie feel something missing perfect acting , one best actor time nobody better Ledger Joker .
 going maximum rating barely average film ? According IMDb , best film decade far . one sane person could argue justified . studio finally managed get mass 'believe hype ' ? bit skeptical film , due hype , especially n't impressed Batman Begins , must admit , heist first five minute excellent , thought skepticism unwarranted . Batman turned began speaking like wrestler throat cancer , continued go hill . n't expect film tedious . . far long bored pant . character development , story convoluted over-complex far long . main problem , go nearly every reviewer , even n't impressed , thought Heath Ledger absolutely awful ! people calling posthumous Oscar ? nothing despise 'look ' performance . Ledger trick required portray 'crazy guy ' , including shifting eye , , left right every opportunity , ingeniously , due mouth cut child , keep licking around inside mouth , rather impressive feat method acting actually irritating watching fat man eat chip mouth open . performance utterly self-indulgent seems like sycophant fell . decent acting performance film Eckhart . Caine Morgan bore , Bale , 'employ movie trailer ' voice barely one dimension . would rated film higher n't taken seriously , stand pretentious hyped-up tedious movie . last , dark truth .
 Okay , hate ... .this movie really good . First : Ledger good , time felt unsure performance everything Joker , dark , witty sickly humorous . thing make film worth watching . Every time screen wanted every-time left lamented got bored pop corn action stupid high budget film affect ... far traditional film making tender . bad old method acting left sleep deprived well , longer alive . one film end career certainly . Second : Maggie Gylenhal hot , Wayne gone three girl pulled copter , wow . Third : thug movie sucked , scared ever , really performance make laugh . Fourth : BAT CAVE ... .enough said . Fifth : many story going , never fully develop hoped would ... Somewhat similar Prestige NOlAN . Sixth : Harvey Dent okay , however turned 2-face looked flat stupid ... funny . n't GET WRONG . RAVING MOVIE , SAW LAST NIGHT WELL GOD ... .IT NOTHING . base film worth make feel , end , felt annoyed Joker center piece film . EVERYTHING PREDICTABLE ... .I guess expect postmodern popcorn flick ( centered around spectacle ) concerned instant gratification digging figure latent meaning . Sure ... end Batman stay shadow , thats ending tell u . n't ALWAYS KNOW ? ? ? ? ? really cant go ... Batman Begins much better film . people strongly head film destined great matter end result , head tell thing ... great ... really cliché action flick highlighted Mr . Ledger . called film `` Joker '' course , `` serious ? '' . course like said , focused one original performance year Ledgers . Nough said , pop corn lover .
 REALLY think better film Godfather ? Good , Bad Ugly ? Seven Samurai , Pulp Fiction ? OK , Joker stand performance , rest good , really best film time ? Ca n't see happened , 30 year sink middle pile be.You want examination good evil duality man ? Watch King New York . 's better film . 'm saying 's worth seeing , please , best film time ... ..This may best Batman film 've seen , frankly enjoyed Iron Man . action good , story reasonable , good supporting act , whole experience n't move like Shawshank redemption , n't seismic shift film-making like Pulp Fiction Godfather . direction - better Sergio Leone ? film n't hyped much , coming ?
 Oddly enough , n't go theater watching blockbuster movie expectation 'll over-hyped bloated ; 's turn time time . , reasonable expectation like next guy.As check reaction Dark Knight , notice common thread - everyone like movie . Particularly , everyone seems enamored Heath Ledger 's unhinged , magnificent , terrifying performance Joker . Straight , want make clear completely agree . Ledger n't ham acting clown costume ; Jack Nicholson already , nearly twenty year ago . Ledger command screen over-the-top performance scene-stealing , subtle one . makeup mask despicable demon hurt sake causing pain also troubled , carefully shaded character worthy Shakespeare 's finest plays.Let 's first get n't like . Many main role miscast , sometimes badly . Christian Bale return Caped Crusader , anything performance wooden movie 's predecessor , Batman Begins . See , 've always thought complex Batman character someone 's consumed inner demon , one even unmasked reveals layer hinting much greater depth . never get impression Bale Batman : see , little . Yes , know 's got secret identity thing going , n't tell people everything , 's nice . Endearing , even . Bale 's inadequacy actor show spade , never get feeling 's meet eye . Bale 's Batman n't feel like 's consumed demon least ; seems like pretty boy lot money like torture ( yes , torture ) kill bad guy without blame acclaim.Moving along , new Rachel Dawes , aka Love Interest , played time Maggie Gyllenhaal , 's monumental improvement wretched performance Katie Holmes gave Batman Begins . Even , noted elsewhere , Gyllenhaal intelligent , eye ironically knowing , play role . seems place , 's smarter Rachel Dawes - assistant DA - . ( course , n't see much Rachel DA stuff ; see running place place panic , professing love Harvey Dent nonverbal way , smiling coquettishly . ) : Like Maggie Gyllenhaal , LOT , far better character written . Someday 'll get right.And 's third wheel love triangle : Harvey Dent , played Aaron Eckhart . , set aside Tommy Lee Jones 's performance Dent one earlier Batman movie , new Bativerse , 's like movie never happened . Dent eventually becomes physically mentally scarred Two-Face , Eckhart ca n't quite handle heavy lifting complicated character demand . see Eckhart , think likable cad , slightly slimy guy 's better real hero basically everything . charming way . , Dent 's noble crusader , district attorney 's going clean Gotham , Eckhart another toothy , slick , Ken doll 's look good . way Eckhart play Dent , 'd think affable fellow want right thing ; Bruce Wayne , n't seem undercurrent ulterior motif , nothing see , please disperse . Eckhart , despite studied split personality preparing role , clearly way head here.The movie overlong , even bloated . seems thing nowadays movie end several time - know , keep Great Unwashed toe . Oh goodness ! 's yet ! happen next ? surely 's way without producing film 's two half hour long . 're going make movie long , guest , movie hero running action scene action scene , particularly action scene dark , dank Gotham City.But positive , make sure base covered . Morgan Freeman Michael Caine exude effortless efficiency Lucien Alfred , respectively , far movie . act Bruce 's conscience , role written completely believable . Professionalism always plus casting superhero movie . vaunted action scene lot fun watch , although many seem involve Batman jumping building , Batman climbing side building , Batman throwing someone else building . dark . 's supposed gloomy ol ' Gotham.So , Dark Knight disappointment . 's bad little film , felt loose , writer Christopher Jonathan Nolan decided ending threw everything could think plot reach goal . happens lot middling action film - hero race point , escape certain death , race point B , escape certain death , repeat ad infinitum . sort thing , n't even get clever plotting might expect 's purportedly higher grade superhero movie . 's much chaos Dark Knight , ultimately maelstrom disorder consumes , rather engages , viewer . Dark Night elegy great potential - realized unrealized - 's forever lost death Heath Ledger .

Chris Nolan gave u excellent Memento think another good film Insomnia . Though appreciate lack CGI ( refreshing ) last half hour film , fidgeted throughout end felt could left early .

Tim Burton aimed weird hit target . Joel Schumacher aimed Ken Russell missed oh wide . Christopher Nolan company got key franchise something certifiably different . Hat 's that.In sum ... half-hour long , final half-hour action-packed befuddlement capped one two unnecessary speech effectively blotted packed action.Heath Ledger 's performance echo mind time come . echoed .

 Christopher Nolan 's 'The Dark Knight ' big bold production . great special-effects , sharp editing affecting score sweep film high-entertainment package . vast improvement Batman Begins reaching higher level storytelling . Although self-evident inadequacy script breakthrough film . Dark Knight long film , respect surprisingly fails somewhat provide enough depth . Instead get scene obvious ineptitude police enable plot continue wish . example , police officer cell Joker entirely unnecessary ? therefore sometimes fall comic book experience conflicting unfortunately superior film element . However , forgiven ( ) Nolan produced successful cross-over somewhat comic book feature Batman Begins . Heath Ledger stunning Joker providing emotional context thrill . set-pieces grand gripping.A minor point , could get away particular moment Bale discussing gadget Freeman , anyone else feel like watching James Bond Q moment ? Dark Knight breakthrough film majestic gripping Batman predecessor . superior film entertainment hampered long-running time ultimately triumph .

 Normally would give 7.5 10 since cant ' 'll give seven . anyone could rate title high IMDb.com amazing . 's mostly fanboys believe best movie ever best thing since sliced bread fanboys fail notice lack objectivity movie good one , quite flawed nowhere near perfect many fanboys rated.A couple thing noticed watch movie , movie go way long . Even friend agreed huge Batman fan . 3 4 point movie seems like end go another 30 minute . Heath Ledger 's performance top notch Bale Bruce Wayne pulled quite flawlessly , Batman persona bit weak . voice annoying , many time throughout movie , seemingly play second fiddle.I ca n't know Eckhart 's casting Two Face Maggie Gyllenhall n't seem fit seems standalone piece eye candy.There many thing harp 'm knock movie . good point , cinematography great , Joker Two Face played excellently counterpart , mood effective story flowed quite well albeit bit long.BUT movie n't even belong mention great shame many movie fan movie rated higher classic Godfather . Obviously fanboys bought way much hype .
 movie created one box-office record . really expected quite something , left disappointed . 's definitely bad movie . many thing good entertainment worth watching definitely one better movie year , come many flaw . think movie like matrix original , intelligent , better action-sequences n't earned much box-office.The disturbing thing probably amount realism tried put comic book story . always confused viewer . n't work . think hype created America pleased hardcore comic book fan think main reason extremely successful America 's dealing Americas 9/11 Trauma.The whole movie kind propaganda movie government actual foreign policy.When see Batman standing ruin exploded building together fireman evokes image 9/11 . America 's desperate yearning hero . Someone clean scum . made `` '' scum n't really told . super-villain like joker mad comic book . real life mad often matter point view.The prisoner one boat evoke image Guantanamo . justifies illegal often unjustified imprisonment innocent word people `` boat '' . shall mercy . blew chance . still give much deserve . still nice gesture giving kind redemption letting tiny lister throwing detonator outside.In end Batman stand symbol `` W '' , blamed people even though seemingly sometimes n't appreciate even understand it.Next thing often illogically let joker get away . mean come . cut another scene free . Thats cheezy.Batman hit like nothing man n't even bleed bit . real people hit K.O . thought Joker superpower seems invincible.Then wonder quick everything planned without ever getting touch recruited army behind , even though seems ton ton toy soldier . comic book work movie try put lot realism feel weird . First prison foreseeing everything . Maybe need see . felt weird.The action sequence felt really thought trough . whole chase tunnel sequence unrealistic . mean first police somehow never hit back . joker shoot shoot shoot . felt unreal.Maggie Gyllenhall felt miscast . maybe favorite art-house production need someone obviously sex-appeal . never bought fell her.The totally unrealistic wound Harvey dent turning `` two-face '' . Come . one would open wound . n't `` Two-Face '' mad scicophrenic book . never feel mad , like guy trying get revenge . Thats mean , amount realism . mad character book explained madness , main character joker synonym terrorist threatening America n't explained bit . Yeah better way . One might get scarred one self turned man terrorist . better leave explanation out.Then much hyped heath ledger ( r.i.p . ) performance . good great . update Nicholson joker . even talked much like facial expression also resembled Nicholson 's expression . whats hype . still performing good legendary . seen better villains.Then seemed like many point movie resembled `` L.A. Cofidential '' One scene end let Harvey dent die hero one others forgot.So . Worth watching . Good movie . overrated . still n't understand enormous box-office-records .
 good film master piece every one making . One word . Hype . Two face wasted existence known Gordon batman end bother using ( wasting ) character ? , real point Maggie Gylenhall ? ferry bit went far long ( probably could give ledger screen time ) , batbike/pod thing looked really slow spent time spinning wheel looked like excuse release cool toy tie ! could go probably agree blinded hype fact ledger dead see pretty average film . scarecrow arrested start film ? come clear reference end batman begin regarding joker existence completely forgotten next movie . could go 'm sure 'll realise hype died . summery , long , wasted character , bit mi casting f**k batman ultra gruff voice ! nearly choked popcorn first time heard !

 review , watched , wondering brilliant flawless . tiny little `` hard point finger '' thing wrong ? avid Batman fan , devouring Frank Miller graphic novel depict grim gritty side dark Knight . followed tidbit story Dark Knight year . Batman Begins marked beginning one amazing `` ordinary superhero movie '' ever witnessed . Four year later , stepped hall , awaited beginning new movie , excitement almost palpable.I disappointed . movie enough chill sadistic pleasure keep hooked unable look away screen part . yet , credit rolled , queer feeling , though something n't entirely right.A hour sensory overload , could finally think , realized one drawback dwelling many story plot simultaneously . instance , follow joker long , sometimes cumbersome car chase , except final brilliant ( much publicized ) truck sequence , nothing great . lead believe joker man attack psychologically , physically strong . portrayed eloquently interrogation scene.As result car sequence became sort cliché could avoid despite possibility becoming boring sequence otherwise splendid movie . remember , caught yawning.Also considering Joker arch nemesis Batman - yang Dark Ying , absolute bad guy , Two Face pale comparison . doubt , make graphic grotesque excellently done . able believe capable menace Joker manages exude.I could believe Two-Face bad . director somehow failed bring transition character . remember comic book , disaster drove Two Face insane , making dependent coin even small decisions.The real trouble ask , bringing new villain last half hour movie . One made joker 's final confrontation Batman seem little unsatisfying . kept expecting show Joker one last time . n't die , ? Yes , understand Joker arch nemesis , Batman 's great burden never kill Joker , back time ... Ledger dead . know wo n't return . , audience wanted ultimatum . dangling loose end definitely dangling loose joker building top.Enough criticism . Batman fan . son batman , wan na call ( ref : Frank Miller ) . loved style . loved bat pod , first robbery sequence , Joker 's pencil disappearing trick , flick tongue , little line Joker completing Batman , line joker dog chase car knowing catch car ... Dark Knight Heath Ledger . Sadly , wanted . N'T ENOUGH ! Batman always sporting best , flight sequence brilliant , Caine Freeman best line apart Ledger . Aaron Eckhart great job Harvey Dent , though feel Two-Face lacked character . expected sort chill Javier Bardem inspired country old men , toss coin . Instead , Two-Face 's toss merely passably interesting . Oh , must really commend Nolan brother away female lead , sudden scary way . almost could n't believe it.Enough spoken Ledger . want repetitive . Clearly , line best . important body language sequence , say least , eccentric . Kudos Nolan good script , something could give Ledger opportunity mind blowing performance . sparkle every scene , wish much him.A word Bale . Batman , best ever . Bruce Wayne , excel scene . scene requiring Bruce Wayne driving around Lamborghini necessary ? quest make Joker remarkable villain ever , dilemma made Batman Dark Knight never questioned . Batman Begins good job bringing character . leave like hanging like prop actor one ? sequence could doubt shortened . Batman could given character Two Face could 've surprise element , somewhat definite end JOKER , movie would tad awesome . would given 10 . Instead give 9 . dare give le ... Background score brilliant . scene involving Joker , mutilates someone , pop psychological question , well , horrifying . almost squirming seat.Over brilliant movie . landmark Batman film , end right note , ready jump headlong next phase Batman 's life . hope n't take four year ! Long Live Batman franchise . Long live Nolan fraternity . RIP ledger .
 Writing review tail end opening weekend , Dark Knight broken record opening weekend deservedly ... film step-above standard summer blockbuster . However , film also sits atop IMDb 's top 250 film all-time list , ranking wo n't last nearly long box-office rank . Lines long see film , many voting opening weekend die-hards waited line ready love film regardless offered . course , fact film stand alone genre term writing , cinematography , art design , plot help boost rating stratosphere , non die-hards begin watch vote , 'll see film settle rightful place , somewhere top 25 time . one film entertaining accessible enough please people went drove Spiderman 3 , artistic smart enough please discerning cinematic audience . Truly disturbing , character far cliché , one would expect genre . character all-good all-bad . Ledger 's Joker come close , earns touch sympathy . None hero flawless , sign good film . single complaint ( besides various hard-to-believe fall Batman survives ) rating . film far-too disturbing garner PG13 rating , deal ugliest side humanity way probably accompanied good conversation add perspective ... yet another reason film good .
 Seeing rated third best movie time IMDb voter , ranking huge box office , thought 'd give swing.I mostly wish n't bothered . Like super-hero movie nowadays , 's one gigantic battleship movie , weighed humongous budget massive running time . many sub-plots need ? many conflicted character , staring depth pompous soul ? Visually - great . vfx crew credited seamless impressive work ever done , city , batmobile , bat bike etc . Brilliant stuff.But story , script , pacing - pretty blaah . give damn character ? really care going happen next ? Nope . actually know going half time , various criminal , money , money laundering guy , Joker , various Police Departments ( hell `` County '' ? ) . , , . Boring . actually looking watch.The one intriguing episode film - ferry - shoved three quarter way film , unceremoniously dumped served purpose sticking bit film together.So , , wish 'd spent time way .
 Dark Knight intensely powerful , dramatic compelling film , despite 'm sure really enjoyed great deal . saw huge IMAX screen London , ability almost suck action make feel part film , time various aspect film meant felt alienated character plot . Batman , really know ? watched whole film ( 2.5 hour ) , 'm sure could say . motif ? really love Rachel - indeed capacity love ? , hint given , central character poorly developed make hard really care happens around . inability empathise character n't helped ridiculous number sub-plots , rushed incomplete , relentless pace film move one . film would much better stuck simpler storyline , developed character theme within that.The frenzied sequence largely unrelated action set-pieces , whilst initially breathtaking , ended feeling dull predictable . lacking explosion anything resembling meaningful dialogue . mumbled word Batman inane musing Joker n't enough keep film going.As , left film feeling somewhat exhausted bleak , joyless , violent world witnessed , disappointed much-hyped film n't good hoping would .
 Yes , Joker really great , overall movie total letdown.A totally stupid thing killed movie . *Spoilers* Joker blow freaking HOSPITAL BROAD freaking DAYLIGHT make escape ultra fast SCHOOL BUS , cop seems able stop , even though 've warned Joker , know , blow hospital . see , totally believable cop apparently set perimeter two freaking mile away , safe . 's like could used helicopter something surveillance . would make much sense ( sarcasm ) .Batman fall several story ground , , TWICE get without much broken bone , hey , 's okay super duper special armor , ( strong dog chew ) protected fall . 's totally realistic ! Right ? 's say ? metal roof Taxi totally cushioned fall . Well , 's even BETTER ! wonderfully realistic . ever jump burning building 's nice know kevlar vest strategically placed car break fall.Police Commissioner Gordon pretend dead Joker chase Harvey Dent instead family ( huh ? ) Joker proceeds kill six innocent people middle downtown Chicago , uh , Gotham City , okay , drawing Joker , police protecting public harm . reason clear street pedestrian traffic stuff transporting Harvey Dent bait sicko maniac killer.Joker manages keep pencil perfectly balanced table large gangster stomp across floor fight . Cool , stupid.Joker burn pyramid money , see , money important . 's important blowing burning stuff , exactly robs bank living . Makes perfect sense , ? Batman speaks annoying rasp hide Bruce Wayne voice everyone know , Christopher Nolan want REALISTIC depiction Batman , sonar cell phone movie magic armor explosive laced Bat Mobiles turn motorcycle gravity defying 360 turn walls.Other complaint : Wayne Manor film . Bat cave . Chicago look bit bright modern Gotham City . Seriously , Gotham City without , know , Gothic architecture ? girl playing Rachel Dawes completely ugly , reason Bruce Wayne obsessed decides sex whole Gotham City ballet , ca n't go date Harvey Dent.I know lot people got drawn hype seeing Heath Ledger 's last great performance , besides Joker , redeeming value film . 's iconic battle . real hero root ( seriously , hate Batman movie ) .Christopher Nolan get special mention trying inject least intelligence summer blockbuster , one many stupid thing justify price admission . n't seen film , wait DVD .
 film like ever compared film like godfather laughable , big comic book superhero fan particularly like genre like way handled whatsoever..the following point highlight case batman nothing okay film.. 1- CONCEPTION CREATION everyone know one exciting thing villain creation , became way , believe original batman film Tim Burton directed handled brilliantly , look Spiderman 2 great villain . flashback even creation joker character must believe along , well Two Face who original coming liked better batman forever , say like tommy lee Jones character portrayal better 1.2-VIOLENCE film left bitter taste viewing fan violent film seen way edited ensure upper catorgory pg-13 12a ( uk ) left film looking feeling like something missing . Instead showing conseqeunce example bullet head camera would cut away leaving audience imagination , another example showing violence actually changing tone film robocop R rated version compared X rated version seems lighter tone.3-BATMAN Batman played Bale one favourite actor opted stupid gruff sounding voice n't work , also suit caste terrible mean truly bad , batman suit made look like well equipped navy seal something , true mysticism batman lost film . reference bat whatsoever throughout duration . Another letdown fight sequence even though Bale lot look smooth , good big screen.4-PLOT/PACINGthe plot many twist turn leaf le cerebral likely lost ( course ) . pacing bad one key action sequence middle film blow away film never lived particular sequence shame , le morality preachyness ACTION ! note spoiler warn hand , ending must say disliked lot , lack realism , depth completion left much open happens joker character , 2 cent please reply maybe differing opinion mine , Spiderman 2 one greatest comic book translation film , earlier batman , ( including return ) never uttered sentence film like Godfather , believe one greatest time , greatest believe upon time America .
 know review get bunch unhelpful vote somebody tell truth ! Dark Knight wildly overrated overrated movie time . Forget Titanic , Boondock Saints King Kong ( 2005 ) . movie surpasses come sheer hype . record love Batman Begins . thought fresh beginning series rendered ineffective lunatic Joel Schumacher . Christian Bale fared well Batman Bruce Wayne rest cast great job also . movie ... . Everything made Batman Begins great absent pretentious slop . cast look like 'd rather somewhere else . Let break way stink movie.The plot : Idiotic beyond belief . Joker ( Heath Ledger ) plan kill city official playing childish game Batman . time 's killing people 's aligned making moronic villain superhero movie history . Batman join force Commissioner Gordon stop him.The acting : Christian Bale wooden role ( Batman Bruce Wayne ) . spends movie looking like 's stoned mind . voice ? Batman Begins sounded cool like one gangster old 1940s flick . sound like Dirty Harry strep throat . Aaron Eckhart flat Harvey Dent Two-Face . Two-Face better Tommy Lee 's Two-Face looking good default never good . Michael Caine , Gary Oldman Morgan Freeman sleepwalk whole movie . Maggie Gyllenhaal quite awful Rachel Dawes . Katie Holme 's Rachel Dawes strong willed lawyer fought 's right . Maggie 's Rachel Dawes need grow find better priority . agree step Katie Holmes play Rachel Dawes like silly high school girl pathetic crush Bruce Wayne . fact asked feel sympathy Joker capture bit stretch . getting roasted made day though lol ! talk town : Heath Ledger Joker . Heath Ledger 's performance okay say better Jack Nicholson 's Joker hilarious say least . Jack Nicholson 's Joker style , plan pretty funny well unpredictable . course silly fun . Heath Ledger 's Joker predictable back story real plan . random act chaos . Ra 's Al Ghul plan , Joker Batman 1989 plan , Penguin Batman Returns plan . weirdo nothing bluff . Plus 's fun spends time ridiculously philosophizing like corny emo-goth kid smoke copious amount cigarette yapping misery life . complete ? 's cheesy Tumbler turning crappy motorcycle . Speaking Emo-Goth kid exactly Joker . people actually find cool instead pathetic.Action sequence : predictable fault . Car chase fight scene plus quite unrealistic . People get punched , kicked , shot , bitten dog knocked around explosion walk away without bump , bruise , cut blood . , Im gore hound get shot bitten dog , would expect see blood . Dark Knight though . Pacing : movie build pace slow ward action screen movie still find time boring . Plus 2 hour 32 minute movie feel longer need . Various subplots never connect best describe movie.Conclusion : Dark Knight overrated , hypocritical , pretentious piece garbage history cinema . people would like fanboys cant believe people trouncing Tim Burton 's Batman movie foam mouth like rabid dog groupie overcooked sequel . pseudo-intellectual snob n't seem realize movie great time made fun . Tim Burton made type Batman movie wanted make without trying please shill . must seen Tim Burton Batman movie time count still ball watching till day . saw dreck three time still could n't get . even fun . plodding mess get hype deserves . Matter fact , 'll tell much n't like . month Dark Knight computer free via z-share computer suffered virus force erase whole thing , movie z-share never tried get back . tell everything need know feeling movie . Two Thumbs .
 completely fail see movie could considered , even early stage 'The greatest movie time ' ! Heath Ledger pretty good , good . good performance , essentially playing pretty generic psychotic role mantle joker . Christian Bale completely wooden role Bruce Wayne , Batman minor character . Michael Caine Morgan Freeman lend credibility , little . Aaron Eckhardt play rather bland Harvey Dent , , terrific performance.This ridiculous movie , based upon ridiculous concept take seriously found painful watch . script part cringe worthy . plot incoherent , real character arc , save Harvey Dent 's poorly executed . 'sonar imaging ' using Gotham 's 30 million mobile phone real jump shark moment.The violence extreme , especially consider Batman essentially child 's comic . movie revel sadism extreme violence , shame Christopher Nolan glorification this.The art direction extends Batman gadget lo-fi emo make Joker . effort whatsoever made show Gotham anything generic American city.Glaring plot hole abound , dog chewing bat-suit bullet effect Joker somehow able blow entire hospital despite giving prior warning ! Joker describes 'agent chaos ' random thing , yet everything meticulously planned . joker real sense humour , rarely ever smile total deviation comic character.This film - personally - signifies death blockbuster . might made vast amount money box office , set appeal lowest common denominator.The Dark Knight humourless , negative , sadistic movie substance , weak script , one reviewer pointed pseudo-intellectual monologue pseudo- philosophical rambling ended someone getting punched shot.An immature film kid , really made adults.I n't want see , waste time . film junk food , bad soul .
 one best superhero movie time . movie composed right people playing right part . movie would great n't Heath Ledgers ' phenomenal acting . Sad part took toll life think sacrificed life order play best villain time . Oh yea Christian Bale fun batman watch . think represent batman unlike Batman v Superman Batman . n't remember batman stone cold killer Nolan guy good ... great job .

 Dark Knight slick production value impressive acting , much poorly paced poorly written . amazes movie could stellar term execution , yet lackluster term conception . say 's apparent many people involved cinematography , costume , makeup , sound , special effect , editing , etc . good work , amount talent could save weak script . 's really reason care character , actually bored throughout much movie . Dark Knight masquerade high-quality crime drama , expertly manipulating audience thinking 's going good movie , extent many people actually tricked believing great movie . Dark Knight somehow never life hype . Despite fact many people worked movie really tried make great , Dark Knight 's inability reconcile pretension sophistication silly , comic-book origin ultimately cause reach exceed grasp .
 really n't get gist Batman film . 'm honest think let . one OK , pretty standard Hollywood superhero film . good actor alright job nothing spectacular . movie always top 5 film time n't get ? want entertained hour job n't anything special . Maybe 'm missing something ? ? ? ? ? best batman first best average . Light entertainment guess ? ?

Christian Bale always creative film , work , especially Dark knight 2008 prominent successful Alomes . liked movie lot liked character beautiful film hope dark knight series stop continue like , little like 've seen work Thank Christian Bale Thanks director staff representative
 Gritty crime drama , keeping movie buff mainstream audience mesmerized throughout . Though running time hit two half hour , single dull moment . Highly effective drama , affect audience , still talked today . 's typical good versus bad movie , 's ideology versus ideology - Joker total opposite Batman , term ideology.The approached Nolan took Batman adaptation realism , succeeding ; resulting one main contribution public taking comic book movie serious . One main contributor giant amount comic book adaptation nowadays , good bad , Nolan 's got ta respect making comic book movie taken serious.Though disagree Heath one hold movie , contribution Dark Knight already iconic . Heath 's performance Joker also overshadows protagonist , Batman ; though movie weaker , 's made stronger , referring saying ''a movie good villain . '' Joker upcoming movie audience disappointment , Heath raised expectation unreasonable height . 'm aware Heath 's performance highly praised , may claim 's ''over appreciated , '' 'm expressing thought , find praise reasonable , though bit much times.Christopher Nolan Wally Pfister excellent job showing Gothic gritty , yet realistic ; Gotham . Nolan 's characteristic hand held , shot reverse shot , tend , Dark Knight well . action 's well filmed , easy follow , yet brought , feel danger character facing . feel impacted epicness Nolan succeeded achieving.The Dark Knight 's score done Hans Zimmer James Newton Howard . score powerful excels , anxious ''majestetic '' sound , making already good scene , even better.Fast paced , people enjoy , film buff mainstream audience . succeeds everything 's going , people 's expectation likely met . highly recommend movie wide range audience .
 negative could give movie protagonist overshadows main role hero . , batman movie . let face , good actor movie , Heath Ledger blow everyone away role joker . movie , may one best acting role history . performance life . ( pun intended ) . shame died , great performance , sadly never see . would reasonable supposition believe ledger 's performance may extreme brilliant due psychological issue experiencing time ultimately took life . candle burning bright missed .
